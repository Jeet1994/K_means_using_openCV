###K-means clustering using Python
---
#####A work as a part of my course named : Pattern Recognition.

###Requirements:
1. Python 2.x
2. Matplotlib(pip it!)
3. Numpy (Pip it!)
4. Pandas (Pip it!)
5. OpenCv (Download from OpenCv); [Here is the link for download](https://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/) follow the **[Installing OpenCV from prebuilt binaries](http://docs.opencv.org/3.1.0/d5/de5/tutorial_py_setup_in_windows.html#gsc.tab=0)**instruction for installing.


###Refernces:
1. [Python-ML at OpenCV](http://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.org/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_ml/py_kmeans/py_kmeans_opencv/py_kmeans_opencv.html)
2. [This Awesome Blog](http://opencvpython.blogspot.sg/2013_01_01_archive.html)

###N.B.:
1. The math behind KMeans is not explicitly used because it is already defined in the *kmeans()* function of OpenCV.
2. Self Generated dateset is used.
